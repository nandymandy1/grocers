                <p>
                    Large supermarkets and chains have virtually unlimited budgets and resources which provides them
                    with what seems like an overwhelming competitive
                    advantage. Even though they may charge far more than an independent chain for the very same food,
                    the advanced operational and marketing tools these
                    major chains utilize can outstrip smaller grocers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is a massive expense involved with creating these technology solutions, that can include
                    everything from mobile apps, electronic coupons, robot sales
                    all reminders, proximity and geo-located sales messages and automated email reminders. On top of
                    the marketing benefits found in advanced technology,
                    these larger organizations are also able to take advantage of operational boosts such as lower
                    costs of capital, real-time pricing optimization and loyalty
                    programs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Independent supermarket owners have struggled to create the same sophisticated operational and
                    marketing machines used by major retailers, but no more!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, you can bring this same level of marketing, operations and retail analytics technology to your
                    grocery store with the shared buying power of Grocer
                    Exchange.

                    <p>
                        Taken collectively, independent grocery stores rank as the sixth-largest chain in the United
                        States. As an independent grocer, you
                        belong to a group that annually serves 70+ million consumers and accounts for over $75 billion
                        in gross sales. The Grocer
                        Exchange puts the power of those numbers to work for its member stores.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The multicultural consumer base, primarily served by independents, is the fastest-growing
                        segment in the U. S. grocery market,
                        and consumer packaged goods manufacturers are consistently challenged to reach it effectively,
                        reliably, and consistently.  CPG
                        companies don’t deal directly with individual stores or small groups.

                        certify the register data needed to verify

                    <h5><b>THE POWER OF TECHNOLOGY TO OPTIMIZE YOUR STORES</b></h5>
                    <p>
                        By virtue of their size, big supermarket chains have massive amounts of technology available to
                        run the operations.Independent
                        grocery store owners must know how your customers shop and how to control your store’s
                        inventory to fulfill the products
                        people buy on any given day, week or month.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It’s no longer enough to simply walk the store looking at the shelves to place your order for
                        more inventory. You need the
                        technology tools that will help optimize your inventory based on past buying trends, product
                        sales and seasonality -- and even
                        the weather! A proactive, automated inventory solution assures that you aren’t running out of
                        the products people need
                        and leaving money on the table.

                            The rising cost of energy has been a point of pain for grocers throughout the country. As
                            one of the largest expenses that a
                            grocer incurs on a regular basis, the Grocer Exchange team focused on how to dramatically
                            reduce these costs. We have negotiated
                            aggressive energy discounts from an A+ rated power generator to create a program designed
                            specifically for supermarkets. As a
                            Basic Level member, you will gain access to insider pricing that will immediately reduce
                            your overall energy costs by making you
                            a part of an energy-buying collective of our members.

                            This works particularly well if you have an in-store event that you’d like to promote, as
                            you can create a script that contains a call
                            to action to visit on a particular date and time.

                            Coupon processing is one of the most manual processes in grocery stores, costing a great
                            deal of time and overhead not to mention
                            the slow turnaround time for coupon refunds from CPGs. With our advanced analog and
                            electronic coupon processing and settlement, Grocer Exchange members enjoy an accelerated
                            timeline for receiving their refunds -- often within several working days instead of
                            waiting for many weeks.
