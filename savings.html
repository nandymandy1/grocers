                    There are certain cost of business expenses that you just expect. You may not love paying a big
                    percentage of each order for payment processing and other services, but you know it’s
                    inevitable.

                <p class="mt-2">
                    With Grocer Exchange Membership, you can save up to 10-15% on primary merchant services

                <p class="mt-2">
                    Your larger competitors are already taking advantage of volume discounts, which lets them
                    reduce the overall cost of their products -- helping them edge you out on pricing or selection for
                    your store.

                    When you have the buying power of hundreds or thousands of small to mid-size grocery stores
                    and chains behind you, merchants suddenly become much more interested in your shared
                    buying power -- offering lucrative discounts and incentives that you can either reinvest in your
                    business, or use to take a long overdue vacation.

                <p class="mt-3">
                    At least once a month, you’re reminded of one of the largest ongoing bills in your groceries
                    other than salaries and rent -- energy.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-2">
                    Simply keeping the lights on and the space heated or cooled can sap your budget dry, and this
                    is particularly relevant as energy prices continue to rise across the country. Apart from putting
                    solar panels on your roof, you may not realize there’s a lot that you can do to cut your energy
                    costs.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-2">
                    With Grocer Exchange, you’ll take advantage of the aggressive energy discounts with programs
                    that are developed directly for businesses just like yours. This insider pricing helps you reduce
                    your overall energy costs by adding you to our energy-buying collective.

                <p class="mt-2">
                    The Grocer Exchange energy savings aggregation program uniquely allows members to lock in
                    today’s prices even if you do not activate today or even this year. Switch-over to our program
                    would happen automatically so you would not be subject to any early cancellation fees from
                    your current supplier. The locked-in preferred price is good for up to 5 years.
                </p>
                <h5>ENERGY AGGREGATION PASSPORT PROGRAM</h5>
                <p class="mt-2">
                    Energy Aggregation is a program that allows businesses to create a large buying group of
                    electricity accounts to seek bids for cheaper energy rates. By aggregating, or grouping, a large
                    number of commercial accounts together, economies of scale are created. These economies of
                    scale set conditions for participating businesses to achieve greater savings during a competitive
                    bid situation, than could never have been obtained by the individual customer.

                    The key benefit to Energy Aggregation is the ability for commercial account holders to save
                    money on their energy bills. Based on current market conditions, individual accounts can
                    potentially save 5% to 20% off of their entire bills depending on the rate they sign.
