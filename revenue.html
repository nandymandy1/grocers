                <p>
                    Did you know that there’s a reason large chain supermarkets always seem to have the ready cash
                    that they need for expansion and updates? These
                    larger organizations can generate revenue in ways that have largely been blocked from local
                    grocers. Our revolutionary revenue sharing program
                    advocates for you and levels the playing field with direct grocer trade opportunities and
                    consumer marketing dollars.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a Grocer Exchange member, you may participate in our exclusive Grocer Exchange Revenue
                    Sharing Program.  Once enrolled and certified, your
                    supermarkets may benefit from a significant amount of extra consumer traffic and terrific sums
                    of consumer and trade marketing dollars to
                    increase, accelerate and turbocharge your profitability and growth. Once certified and
                    established, you can watch your bottom line grow.
                </p>
                <h5 class="text-uppercase"><b>Your Grocer Exchange Passport to CPG Dollars</b></h5>
                <p>
                    A single grocery supermarket would have a hard time negotiating with major CPGs to gain
                    advertising dollars. When you are a part of Grocer
                    Exchange, we approach the CPG marketers as a collective. In the process, you are not singled
                    out as a single supermarket, instead, as part of a
                    buying collective. As a Grocer Exchange fully-certified supermarket or supermarket group, you
                    immediately gain credibility and the revenue
                    associated with being a part of the Grocer Exchange collective.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a part of Grocer Exchange, your product case movement and unit volume can be counted and
                    verified -- allowing you to quality for very large
                    amounts of consumer and trade marketing dollars as well as selling programs that will help
                    boost your bottom line. You may actually find that
                    you’re deriving even greater funds than the larger supermarkets!
                </p>
                <p>
                    With your enrollment and certification in the Grocer Exchange revenue share program, you are no
                    longer working as a single, independent
                    supermarket or small group of supermarkets. You’re included in the Grocer Exchange sales base
                    locally, regionally and nationally.  These benefits
                    are yours when you join Grocer Exchange, and you’ll receive dollars you have never received
                    before thanks to your newly established access to
                    these massive pools of marketing dollars.

                    What will draw your potential shoppers away from their “normal” shopping experience to come
                    into your supermarket? Or, what will encourage them to come visit you more often than their
                    regularly-scheduled
                    shopping trip? Impulse trips can drive significant revenue opportunities for supermarkets and
                    CPG manufacturers alike. These pre-arrival strategies are sure to keep your grocery supermarket
                    humming, increase
                    weekly visits and reduce the elapsed time between visits to your business.

                        <p>
                            Electronic Coupons are utilized by shoppers of all ages and are much appreciated due to the
                            convenience of using them when compared to print coupons. We provide a digital wallet for
                            each of your registered
                            or newly acquired shoppers which are tied directly to The Grocer Exchange GEX Rewards
                            shopper loyalty program. Your shoppers and your cashiers will find it fast and convenient
                            to access special sponsored
                            offers.  As a Grocer Exchange member, CPG manufacturers will clamor to have their coupons
                            converted by your shoppers quickly and easily. Offering electronic coupons is one of the
                            best ways to enrich the
                            data that you gather about your shoppers. This is extremely important, as the Grocer
                            Exchange Retail Analytics Teams operates seven days a week and 24 hours a day to process
                            the data that inspires
                            CPG marketers to want to invest more in promoting their items to your shopper base.
                            Additional coupons can be customized based on documented and analyzed shopper buying
                            patterns to manifest
                            increased visits and larger basket sizes while reducing the time between visits to your

                    While remote digital sales promotion programs are often the easiest to administer, you will likely
                    receive a significant revenue boost from fixed placement tactics. This is due to the size and scale
                    of the installation
                    that will fit within the space and the standard dollar volume of your supermarket. Manufacturers
                    are looking for any way possible to make their products stand out from the rest, and these fixed
                    placement tactics
