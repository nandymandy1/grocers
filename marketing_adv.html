                <h5>WEEKLY INTEGRATED ELECTRONIC CIRCULARS</h5>
                <p class="mt-3">
                    Shoppers are accustomed to looking for a weekly circular, plotting their sales and shopping for
                    the week by seeing which grocery retailer has the best specials. Our Grocer Exchange Rewards
                    weekly digital circulars are one of the most effective sales promotion tools for your supermarket.
                    In addition to driving volume, turns and increased basket sizes, they also generate commercial
                    revenue for your supermarket by directly delivering incremental CPG marketing funds
                    associated with brand marketing to those consumers who actually shop in your supermarket.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-2">
                    As you shoppers arrive or as opportunities may arise, The Grocer Exchange can provide you
                    with special offers, activated by unique conversion data and consumer insights. This information
                    is then utilized to make the participating brands more effective at marketing to your shoppers. In
                    essence, the CPG marketers are going to pay you to grow your sales.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-2">
                    It’s easy to see the value of the circular, but it’s still a challenge to find time to create them
                    every
                    week. Finding images, creating marketing copy, identifying SKUs to feature, making it all look
                    good on the page -- it’s all a never-ending cycle and there are so many other places where you
                    could use that marketing effort. With our unique digital circular program, we leverage the
                    exceptional information that has been added to Grocer Exchange to create a customized
                    circular based on business parameters that you define.

                    Through a system of unique programs developed by The Grocer Exchange Shopper Marketing
                    Network, we can arrange to have unique signage installed in your store absolutely free.  Based
                    upon the effectiveness of that signage, The Grocer Exchange may even pay you for letting us
                    incentivize your shoppers to buy new items or sale offerings seven days a week, 365 days a
                    year. The cost of installation and this advanced market development is exclusively available to
                    select Grocer Exchange members thanks to annual volume and revenue generation
                    agreements which we have negotiated with the top CPG’s for decades.

                By creating an enticing interior for your store, you are communicating to CPG manufacturers
                that you have the capability to meet their promotional needs. The result? Marketers are more
                likely to invest in your store than in your competitor’s store -- ultimately providing you with
                additional sales revenue and sponsor income.
